# Spaceways Color Schemes

Light and dark color schemes for Nova inspired by [spacemacs-theme][1], the official themes for the Spacemacs distribution of Emacs.

Most of the colors are taken from spacemacs-theme, but not all. Nova and Emacs have very different ideas of default syntax scopes; don't expect the _way_ the colors are used between the two editors to be identical.
